**Be careful when purchasing hacking cheats to avoid scams. More projects to come.**

**You can easily employ the mapper by incorporating the compiled binaries into your project. Refer to the provided "Injection.h" header for more comprehensive guidance. Ensure that the compiled binaries are present in your program's working directory. Upon the initial launch, the injection module will download PDB files for both the native version of "ntdll.dll" and, when executed on x64, the wow64 version, to resolve symbol addresses. To initiate the download, use the exported "StartDownload" function. It's important to note that the injector can only operate once the downloads have been completed. The injection module exports "GetSymbolState" and "GetImportState," which will return "INJ_ERROR_SUCCESS (0)" once the PDB download and the resolution of all required addresses are finished. Furthermore, you can utilize "GetDownloadProgress" to track the download's progress as a percentage. If you intend to unload the injection module during the download process, make use of "InterruptDownload," as failing to do so might lead to your process becoming deadlocked due to the DLL.**
